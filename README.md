# macfand

Daemon for controlling fans on linux systems using applesmc and coretemp.

This project was written from scratch, but was highly influenced by the famous [mbpfan](https://github.com/linux-on-mac/mbpfan). Please, check [mbpfan](https://github.com/linux-on-mac/mbpfan) out. That is why I kept the GPL-3.0. I rewrote it mostly for fun and exercise, but also to have more control over it.

It has **automatic detection** of all your **fans**, their **settings** (max and min speed), maximal **temperatures** and hardware temperature **monitors**.

**This is unofficial software and by using it you agree to taking full responsibility for possibly damaging your computer.**

## Prerequsities

Make sure you have loaded `coretemp` and `applesmc` kernel modules by running:

```bash
lsmod | grep -e coretemp -e applesmc
```

These modules should be loaded if you are running linux on a Mac, but if they are not, add these two lines to `/etc/modules`:

```bash
coretemp
applesmc
```

## Installation

*Arch AUR package will be available.* 

This installation method is using the included `macfand.service` to enable macfand on startup using systemd. If you wish not to use systemd for activation of macfand on startup, remove all lines including `systemctl` from the `Makefile`, continue with this guide and finally enable macfand using your autostart method.
